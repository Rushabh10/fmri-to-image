# fmri-to-image
Project for the NYU Computer Vision Course

This project investigates fMRI-based image reconstruction using the BOLD5000 dataset. We implemented and experimented with 5 different techniques for this task - 
1) Multi-Channel Input Feed-Forward Network
2) Single Channel Input Feed-Forward Network
3) Autoencoder based approach
4) Generative Adversarial Network
5) CLIP and Diffusion
